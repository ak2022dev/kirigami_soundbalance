Design and coding notes
=======================

As this is my first kirigami app, I plan to code in an exploratory fashion.
First, I am to get an application window visible, using the kirigami helloworld
tutorial for inspiration.

In helloworld, the first step was to create the directory structure manually. I will do similar for this app.

I am using the page below for guidance:

<https://develop.kde.org/docs/getting-started/kirigami/introduction-getting_started/>

I have setup the directory structure and empty files as-per the example.

Next I will enter the main.qml file as-per the example.
